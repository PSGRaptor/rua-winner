Running Local dev (recommended)

Uses the built-in API route, so parquet import works.
# from repo root
pnpm install
pnpm -C packages/core build
pnpm -C apps/web dev -p 3000
Open: http://localhost:3000

Production-like server test

Build once, then run the Node server (API included).
pnpm -C packages/core build
# build without the export toggle so it runs as a server:
# (no need to set NEXT_DESKTOP_EXPORT here)
pnpm -C apps/web build
pnpm -C apps/web start -p 3000

Static export preview (matches desktop bundle behavior)

Static export has no API, so point the UI to a server for /api/parse-parquet.
The easiest is to run the dev server as the API and serve the static files separately.

Terminal A – start API server on 3000
pnpm -C apps/web dev -p 3000

Terminal B – build with API base baked in, then serve static
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE="http://localhost:3000"
pnpm -C packages/core build
pnpm -C apps/web build    # writes apps/web/out
npx --yes serve apps/web/out -l 8080
Open: http://localhost:8080
(Your UI loads from the static export, while API calls go to the dev server on 3000.)
